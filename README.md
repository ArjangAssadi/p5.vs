# p5.vscode 

Create p5.js projects in Visual Studio Code. This extension is aimed at beginners and students (particularly those in my classes!) who might be moving on from the p5.js online editor.

The `Live Server`  and `p5js Snippets` extensions are also bundled for convenience.

I'm aware there are a few other VS Code extensions that do something similar, but they either seemed buggy or didn't quite met my requirements.

## Instructions

1. Open the Command Palette with `command-shift-p` and then type `Create p5.js`. 
2. Select a new empty folder to put your project in.
3. Click on `sketch.js` in the workspace that opens up.
4. (optional) click the "Go Live" button in the bottom status bar to open your sketch in a browser

## Features

- Creates a p5.js project by populating an empty folder with required html/css/js files.
- Avoids CDN use so that project creation can work offline.
- Comes bundled with other recommended VS Code extensions to make life easier for beginners & students.
